# Introduction

So, two years ago I decided that I wanted to work on a new hobby of mine: mechanical keyboards. I spent a lot of time searching for keyboards and components, mostly reading the wonderful wiki of [r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. After some time, I found the beautiful guide prepared by [Matt3o](){}, which described how to hand-wire a mechanical keyboard. What does it mean to hand-wire? Basically, in a standard mechanical keyboards, all the electronic components are placed and soldered on a [Printed Circuit Board](){}, shortly, a PCB. In the case of hand-wired mechanical keyboards, there is no PCB at all.
